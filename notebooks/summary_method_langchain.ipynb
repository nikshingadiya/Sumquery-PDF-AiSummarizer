It covers topics such as ML development, training operationalization, continuous training, model deployment, prediction serving, continuous monitoring, and data and model management. It outlines an MLOps framework that defines core processes and technical capabilities to help organizations establish mature MLOps practices for building and operationalizing ML systems. It also discusses the challenges organizations face when attempting to deploy ML at scale, such as lack of talent, integration issues, and deployment challenges. ML engineering is essential for building ML-enabled systems, and MLOps is a superset of software engineering that deals with the complexities of practical ML applications.\n"
