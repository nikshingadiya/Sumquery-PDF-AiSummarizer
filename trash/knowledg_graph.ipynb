He began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School. In 1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress, and after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and graduated from what was then Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: \"likes math; a future stockbroker\". After finishing high school and finding success with his side entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into business but was overruled by his father.Buffett showcased an interest in business and investing at a young age. He was inspired by a book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at age seven, One Thousand Ways to Make $1000. Much of Buffett\\'s early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. In one of his first business ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola, and weekly magazines door to door. He worked in his grandfather\\'s grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. On his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route. In 1945, as a high school sophomore, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the local barber shop. Within months, they owned several machines in three different barber shops across Omaha. They later sold the business to a war veteran for a tidy sum of $1200.\\nBuf', metadata={'title': 'Warren Buffett', 'summary': 'Warren Edward Buffett ( BUF-it; born August 30, 1930) is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist.

The review commented, \"There’s another paradox the film hints at, too: the qualities that made it challenging for Buffett to deal with people are the very qualities that made him such a brilliant investor.\" The New Yorker observed, \"It’s also about an ability to divorce yourself from emotion, to be rational at a time when other people are acting irrationally, and to be calm when others are fearful.\"The New York Times noted the documentary told Buffett\\'s biography \"in a relatively new way\". The review commented that, though the overall portrayal of the man was positive, it also described Buffett, \"as something of a remarkable human computer, gifted with numbers and less so with interpersonal relationships.\"Money observed the film is, \"Chock full of the traditionalist eccentricities the \\'oracle of Omaha\\' is best known for–like his love of Coca Cola, and the fact that he lives in the same house he bought in 1958 for $31,500\". Money pointed out that the documentary went more in-depth than these specifics about Buffett, and \"reveals a surprising set of facts even Buffett die hards may have missed.\"According to the film critic news aggregation analysis on Rotten Tomatoes, the documentary garnered positive reviews from the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, and a negative review from Entertainment Weekly.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nBecoming Warren Buffett at IMDb', metadata={'title': 'Becoming Warren Buffett', 'summary': 'Becoming Warren Buffett is a 2017 documentary film about Warren Buffett and his life.

Her father, William Hertzog Thompson, was a minister, psychologist, dean at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, and one-time campaign manager for Howard Buffett.\\nThough her parents and Warren\\'s knew one another, they met at Northwestern University, via Susan\\'s roommate Roberta Buffett, Warren\\'s sister.\\nSusan and Warren married in 1952 at the Dundee Presbyterian Church in Omaha. They had three children together: Susan (born July 30, 1953), Howard (born December 16, 1954), and Peter (born May 4, 1958).Allegations have been made regarding Susan\\'s conduct during her marriage to Warren. These include claims that in the mistaken belief her husband had cheated on her with his friend, Katharine Graham, she sent Graham a passive-aggressive letter that \"let her date Warren Buffett\", and that she had a relationship with her tennis coach, John McCabe.She occasionally performed hit classics from the early 1970s cabaret singer and, in 1977, had a one-night performance at an Omaha theater. Encouraged by songwriter/musician Neil Sedaka to pursue a singing career, she left her husband and moved to a small apartment in San Francisco with her paramour, John McCabe, in Gramercy Tower on Nob Hill.

Warren flew out from Omaha to be with her every weekend during her recovery and the couple would later contribute $6 million to five California doctors for the study of oral cancer.  She had recovered enough to attend the annual shareholders\\' meeting of Berkshire Hathaway in May 2004, leading a singalong at the Borsheim\\'s reception.Susan died at the age of 72 after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage during the summer of 2004 in Cody, Wyoming. Bono performed \"Forever Young\" and \"All I Want Is You\" at her funeral.  Warren was so grief-stricken that he did not attend.  She left approximately $50 million to her children\\'s charity while each of her children received $10 million and each grandchild received $100,000.

Chace, who was a carpenter, started working for Samuel Slater, the founder of the first successful textile mill in America. Chace founded his first textile mill in 1806. In 1929, the Valley Falls Company merged with the Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing Company established in 1889, in Adams, Massachusetts. The combined company was known as Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates.In 1955, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates merged with the Hathaway Manufacturing Company which had been founded in 1888 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, by Horatio Hathaway with profits from whaling and the China Trade. Hathaway had been successful in its first decades, but it suffered during a general decline in the textile industry after World War I. At this time, Hathaway was run by Seabury Stanton, whose investment efforts were rewarded with renewed profitability after the Great Depression. After the merger, Berkshire Hathaway had 15 plants employing over 12,000 workers with over $120 million in revenue, and was headquartered in New Bedford. However, seven of those locations were closed by the end of the decade, accompanied by large layoffs.\\nIn 1962, Warren Buffett began buying stock in Berkshire Hathaway after noticing it was statistically undervalued. Buffett bought the stock with the idea that as Berkshire closed textile mills and freed capital, there would be a tender offer at some point and they could sell the stock for a profit. Eventually, Buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the company's financial situation was not going to improve. In 1964, Stanton made an oral tender offer to buy back Buffett's stake in the company for $111⁄2 per share. Buffett agreed to the deal. A few weeks later, Warren Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $113⁄8. Buffett later admitted that this lower, undercutting offer made him angry. Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire Stanton (which he did). However, this made Buffett the majority owner of a failing textile business.\\nBuffett ini\", metadata={'title': 'Berkshire Hathaway', 'summary': \"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

With a career that spans more than 30 years, Buffett is an Regional Emmy Award winner, New York Times best-selling author and co-chair of the NoVo Foundation. He is the youngest son of billionaire investor Warren Buffett.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early career ===\\nBuffett began his musical career in the early part of the 1980s in San Francisco, California. After dropping out of Stanford University, he used the proceeds of his inheritance from his grandfather to pursue a career in music. He recorded and produced albums for local talent.  His big break came when a neighbor introduced him to his son-in-law who needed ad tunes for a newly conceived station, MTV. The music channel became a cultural phenomenon in the 1980s. He also was hired by ad agencies to compose commercials and logos - including CNN, which like MTV was also new to cable television at the time.\\n\\n\\n=== Music career ===\\n\\n\\n==== 1987–1995 ====\\nBuffett decided to transition from ad to music and he decided that a way to do that is to get a record deal based on movie scores. As new age music was popular in the mid-1980s, he was able to secure one. Narada Productions, a new-age music recording company, signed Buffett to a recording contract.  In 1987, Buffett debuted with Narada, releasing an album entitled The Waiting.  His second album, One by One, was inspired by Evan S. Connell\\'s book \"Son of the Morning Star\". In 1989, Buffett moved to Milwaukee, home of Narada Productions and closer to his childhood home in Omaha, Nebraska.  Buffett would release two more albums with Narada:  Lost Frontier and Yonnondio.\\nWhile with Narada, Buffett had his first major success scoring the \"Fire Dance\" scene in the film Dances with Wolves.  The film score, composed by John Barry, won the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Barry would later invite Buffett to collaborate with him again, this time at the Abbey Road Studios in London.  Buffett contributed the Indigenous soundscapes to the film, and went on to compose two songs for the soundtrack of The Scarlet Letter.\\nAfter the release of Yonnondio, Buffett signed with Epic Records. In 1994, he released his soundtrack for the CBS miniseries 500 Nations, which was produced by Kevin Costner.\\n\\n\\n==== 1996–2005 ====\\nIn 1996, Buffett produced Star of Wonder, a Christmas CD featuring Celtic harpist Kim Robertson and arranger Eric Segnitz. Buffett then signed with Hollywood Records, which released his album Spirit Dance in 1997.\\nIn 1998, he entered the pop music realm with the release of Comet9\\'s \"Like Mercury\" on Milwaukee-based independent label Don\\'t Records, with Buffett producing, writing and playing multi-instrumentalist.  Co-writer and guitarist Tom Nelson and vocalist Susan Zielke completed the studio trio, with Citizen King members D. J. Brooks and Malcolm Michiles guesting on drums and turntables, respectively. The live band added bassist Josh Warner to the lineup.\\nIn 1999, Buffett\\'s score for the documentary Wisconsin: An American Portrait won a Chicago / Midwest Emmy Award for Best Soundtrack.Also in 1999, Buffett\\'s Spirit – A Journey in Dance Drums and Song aired on PBS as a highly successful pledge break special. Combining modern and American Indian dancers with Director and Choreographer Wayne Cilento, Spirit went on to tour through the end of 1999. In 2004, Buffett worked with Jody Ripplinger and Frank Anderson to create Spirit –The Seventh Fire; an updated version of his earlier show. It was premiered on the National Mall during the opening of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian in its 800-seat theater tent.\\n\\n\\n==== 2006–present ====\\nIn 2006, Buffett released his first vocal album, Gold Star.

Despite his wealth, Warren Buffett encouraged his children to be financially independent; Susan Buffett recalled in 2006 that in spite of her father's generosity, he once refused her a personal loan of $41,000 to expand her kitchen.

He was a four-term Republican United States Representative for the state of Nebraska. He was the father of Warren Buffett, the American billionaire businessman and investor.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nHoward Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska to Henrietta Duvall Buffett and Ernest P. Buffett, owners of a grocery business. Ernest P. Buffett\\'s parents were second cousins, both having mainly English descent. The Buffet surname (renamed to Buffett) originates in France with a Huguenot weaver, named John Buffett, who became Buffett\\'s first American Buffett ancestor when he immigrated to New York in the late-1600s. Howard Buffett attended public schools and graduated from the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1925. While a student, Buffett was a brother of the Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity. He married Leila Stahl on December 27, 1925. The Buffetts were active members of the Dundee Presbyterian Church. After failing to secure a job in the family grocery business, he started a small stock brokerage firm.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nEntering the investment business, Buffett also served on the Omaha board of education from 1939 to 1942. In 1942 he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nebraska district in which Omaha was located. In that election, Buffett was seen as \"a Republican sacrificial lamb in Nebraska\\'s second district when FDR was a popular wartime leader.\" Nevertheless, he went on to win the Republican nomination in the primary and then the subsequent general election.\\nHe was reelected twice. In 1948 he again was the Republican nominee for another term, but was defeated for reelection; however, he was the Republican nominee for the office again in 1950 and won the office back. In 1952 Buffett decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha, Buffett-Falk & Co., in which he worked until shortly before his death. He also served as the campaign manager for conservative Senator Robert A. Taft in Taft\\'s 1952 presidential campaign.\\nAccording to Warren Buffett biographer Roger Lowenstein:\\'Unshakably ethical, Howard refused offers of junkets and even turned down a part of his pay. During his first term, when congressional salary was raised from $10,000 to $12,500, Howard left the extra money in the Capitol disbursement office, insisting that he had been elected at the lower salary.\\' His wife said he considered only one issue when deciding whether or not to vote for a bill: \\'Will this add to, or subtract from, human liberty?\\'\\n\\n\\n== Political philosophy ==\\nHoward Buffett is remembered for his highly libertarian Old Right stance, having maintained a friendship with Murray Rothbard for a number of years. He \"would invariably draw \\'zero\\' ratings from the Americans for Democratic Action and other leftist groups.\"Buffett was a vocal critic of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. Of the Truman Doctrine, he said: \"Our Christian ideals cannot be exported to other lands by dollars and guns.\"  Buffett was also \"one of the major voices in Congress opposed to the Korean adventure,\" and \"was convinced that the United States was largely responsible for the eruption of conflict in Korea; for the rest of his life he tried unsuccessfully to get the Senate Armed Services Committee to declassify the testimony of CIA head Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, which Buffett told [Rothbard] established American responsibility for the Korean outbreak.\" The CIA failed to predict the Marxist invasion of the Republic of Korea in 1950, just as it had failed to predict the Soviet Atomic Bomb the previous year - 1949, it was these intelligence failures that Rear Admiral Hillenkoetter testified about.\\nSpeaking on the floor of Congress, he opposed military interventionism:\\n\\nEven if it were desirable, America is not strong enough to police the world by military force.
